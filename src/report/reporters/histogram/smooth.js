// Smoothes histogram. Reasons:
//  - When the sample size is low, each bucket will have small increase|decrease
//    compared to when the sample size is higher. Those creates bumpy edges
//    that are not statically relevant and visually distracting.
//  - Those bumps vary greatly over time, creating some vertical shakiness on
//    each bucket.
//  - This also make the mode shake. Since the mode is used to scale the whole
//    graph, this creates some additional (but separate) vertical shakiness on
//    the whole graph.
