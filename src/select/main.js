// Select combinations according to the `select` configuration properties.
// We use a single `select` property for both inclusion and exclusion:
//  - Selections can be prepended with "not" to exclude
//  - We do not use two separate `include` and `exclude` properties since it
//    would require overriding both when using CLI flags.
//     - For example, if `spyd.yml` was used to `exclude` an id, and we wanted
//       to `include` it as a CLI flag, this would require setting `exclude` to
//       an empty string too.
// Selection could be meant to select combination either for measuring or
// reporting:
//  - In the `show` and `remove` commands, only reporting is happening
//  - However, in the `run` command, we both measure and report.
//  - We purposely do not provide separate configuration properties for both
//    cases because:
//     - Only reporting what is being measured is more intuitive and provides
//       with a stronger focus
//     - This provides with fewer configuration properties, which is simpler
//  - If users use `select` to limit how many combinations are being measured,
//    but still want to see all combinations, they should perform two commands:
//    first `run` then `show`.
// Selection happens after delta resolution:
//  - This means the `count` delta format targets results regardless of whether
//    they are selected
//  - This is because:
//     - Changing `select` does not change the history start|end, which is less
//       confusing
//     - This does not require loading files before resolving deltas
