//    measuring loop fails
//  - Not during `minLoopDuration` estimation since it does not execute the task
//    and the runner is unlikely to create too much output
// We do not check the size before doing it (as a performance optimization)

//  - When logs are low, `stat()` is roughly as slow as `truncate()`
//  - When logs are high, we most likely want to truncate
