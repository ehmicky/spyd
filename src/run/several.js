//     - Roughly doubles stdev
//     - Changes the distribution of each combination
//     - Increases `minLoopDuration` due to processes being spawned in parallel
//  - This lowers the maximum memory usage since only one combination's
//    `measures` is in memory at a time
//  - The downside is that users do not get early results of all combinations
//    at once. However, the `precision` configuration property can be used for
//    this.
