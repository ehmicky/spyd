//     - Makes it less obvious to users that all tasks share that logic
//     - Complicates runners implementation since they would need to load
//       multiple files
//  - The logic would only be shareable within a single runner
// We do not add a way to run some logic once before|after all tasks because:
//  - This can be achieved userland by running commands before|after running
//    spyd
//  - The logic cannot be in the same process as the tasks since they each have
//    their own process
//     - i.e. this would require IPC
//  - Sharing state between tasks creates coupling between them
//  - This makes the task DX/interface more complex
//     - For example, this might create confusion with `before|after` hooks
