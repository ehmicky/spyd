// Measures usually contain some very slow outliers due to background processes
// or engine optimization.

//  - worst-case scenarios (`quantiles`)
//  - average performance when repeated (`mean`)
// However, those are not good when determining the normal distribution of
// measures:
//  - they create a distribution with a very long tail, which is hard to
//    visualize with `histogram`
//  - they make `stdev`, `rstdev`, `moe` and `rmoe` must less useful
// For the later cases, we remove those outliers.
// We also remove the fastest outliers for similar reasons, although they are
// less frequent.
// We apply those percentage without cloning the `measures` array, for
// performance and memory reasons.
