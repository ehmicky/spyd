// Minimum `groupSize`
// A higher value lowers accuracy:

//    size.
//  - This means multiplying this constant by `n` requires running the benchmark
//    `n` times longer to get the same `envDev`
// A lower value lowers precision:
//  - This is because groups with a lower groupSize are less precise
//  - This is especially visible in preview mode, especially when a new group
//    is added
//     - This is because the last group are less precise.
//     - Also, new groups generally have higher `varianceRatio` if the "optimal"
//       size has not been reached yet, so each new group will make `envDev`
//       increase until it reaches its optimal value.
// In general, `envDev` tends to be generally too low, so we favor accuracy over
// precision.
// However, this does mean `envDev` tends to vary quite a lot between different
// `array`.

//  - Leads to an overall slightly worse accuracy
// A higher value:
//  - Leads to much poorer accuracy and precision when the "optimal" size is
//    close to the `array.length`
//     - Specifically when that "optimal" size is higher than
//       `array.length` / (CLUSTER_FACTOR ** 2)
// We must also ensure that `CLUSTER_FACTOR ** MAX_ARGUMENTS >= MAX_SAMPLES`
//  - MAX_ARGUMENTS is the maximum number of arguments to Math.max(): 123182
//  - MAX_SAMPLES is the maximum number of array elements: 123182
//  - Otherwise, `Math.max(...groups)` would crash
// Using an integer >= 2 allows several implementation performance optimizations
