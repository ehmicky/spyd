// Margin of errors depend on the central limit theorem which requires each
// sample value to be independent from each other.
// However, it is common for array of measures not to be fully independent.
//  - In particular, for nearby measures to be more likely to have similar
//    values
// When this happens, aggregating nearby measures removes this dependency.
// This logic guesses the optimal aggregation size (`envDev`):
//  - High enough to make measures independent from each other
//  - But still as low as possible to keep the sample size high
// This works by grouping the `array` with different `envDev` and comparing the
// resulting variance with what it is expected to be, if the resulting array
// measures were fully independent.
// Consumers can use the result (`envDev`) by multiplying it to `stdev` before
// performing statistical computation that rely on measures independence such
// as margin of errors.
// This requires `array` to be at least as high as the optimal aggregation size:
//  - I.e. the `precision` configuration property should be high enough.
// The time complexity is `O(log n)` but very close to `O(n)`
// Measures dependency is common when benchmarking tasks.
//  - In principle, the duration of each task's measure is independent.
//  - However, that duration is multipled by the environment it is running on,
//    both hardware and software
//     - This is stateful, i.e. dependent on time
//  - It is also multiplied by engine optimization
//     - I.e. running a task more tends to make it fast
//     - This is also dependent on time
// Due to each of those being roughly normal, the resulting distribution tends
// to be lognormal.
// The environment variation can have many causes:
//  - Small changes due to OS optimization and caching
//  - Bigger temporary slowdowns due to recurring OS background processes
//  - Temporary slowdowns due to other programs on the machine either:
//     - Left in background
//     - Interacted with by user while benchmark is running
// `envDev` is only a best effort. The environment variation is hard to measure
// precisely because:
//  - Its frequency is hard to predict: it does not follow clear patterns, and
//    is partially user-driven
//  - Its amplitude is variable: it alternates between periods of high and low
//    precision
//  - Its amplitude is unbounded: it can be arbitrarily high
//  - It continuously shifts
// The environment also depends on some global state which can arbitrarly change
//  - For example: OS upgrades, different machines, etc.
//  - This cannot be fixed with `envDev` but instead by:
//     - Using different `system` configuration property to signify environment
//       differences
//     - Keeping the machine load as constant as possible
//        - During the run, e.g. by not using other applications while waiting
//          for the benchmark to end
//        - Between runs, e.g. by using some CI or container
